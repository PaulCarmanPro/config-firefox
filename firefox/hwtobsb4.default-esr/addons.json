When DownloadHelper detects embedded videos it can access for download, the toolbar icon highlights and a simple menu allows you to download files by simply clicking an item.\n\nFor instance, if you go to a YouTube page, you'll be able to download the video directly on your file system. It also works with most other popular video sites like DailyMotion, Facebook, Periscope, Vimeo, Twitch, Liveleak, Vine, UStream, Fox, Bloomberg, RAI, France 2-3, Break, Metacafe, and thousands of others.\n\nVideo DownloadHelper supports several types of streamings, making the add-on unique amongst Video downloaders: HTTP, HLS, DASH, … Whenever a site uses a non-supported streaming technology, Video DownloadHelper is able to capture the media directly from the screen and generate a video file.\n\nBesides downloading, Video DownloadHelper is also capable of making file conversions (i.e. change audio and video formats) and aggregation (combining separate audio and video into a single file). This is an upgrade feature that helps pay for the free stuff (we need to eat too). You are not compelled to use conversion for downloading videos from websites, and you can avoid picking variants marked as ADP to avoid the need for aggregation.\n\nVideo overview on how to use Video DownloadHelper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZT8yI60k_4\n\nSupport can be obtained from the dedicated support forum.\n\nPlease stay tuned by following us on Twitter (@downloadhelper), or Facebook.","weeklyDownloads":62127,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"mig","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/32479/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/25/25993.png?modified=1622132280","width":200,"height":150,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/25/25993.jpg?modified=1622132280","thumbnailWidth":200,"thumbnailHeight":150,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/154/154820.png?modified=1622132280","width":327,"height":124,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154820.jpg?modified=1622132280","thumbnailWidth":327,"thumbnailHeight":124,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper animated toobar icon"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/154/154824.png?modified=1622132280","width":250,"height":200,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154824.jpg?modified=1622132280","thumbnailWidth":250,"thumbnailHeight":200,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper main panel"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/154/154822.png?modified=1622132280","width":361,"height":289,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154822.jpg?modified=1622132280","thumbnailWidth":361,"thumbnailHeight":289,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper main panel"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/154/154826.png?modified=1622132281","width":320,"height":317,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154826.jpg?modified=1622132281","thumbnailWidth":320,"thumbnailHeight":317,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper available actions"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/154/154828.png?modified=1622132281","width":293,"height":250,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/154/154828.jpg?modified=1622132281","thumbnailWidth":293,"thumbnailHeight":250,"caption":"Video DownloadHelper quality variants settings"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.2841,"reviewCount":14488,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/reviews/","updateDate":1670502520000},{"id":"addon@darkreader.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/855/855413-32.png?modified=3f34e276","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/855/855413-64.png?modified=3f34e276","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/855/855413-128.png?modified=3f34e276"},"name":"Dark Reader","version":"4.9.63","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4095037/darkreader-4.9.63.xpi","homepageURL":"https://darkreader.org/","supportURL":"https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader","description":"Dark mode for every website.

Recover your lost work after session timeouts, network failures, browser crashes, power failures and all other things that will destroy the hard work you just put into writing that important email, essay or blog post.\n\nThis extension can also be used as an easy form filler. It will restore text and editor fields as well as various input controls. On each submission of a webform, the state of controls like radio-buttons and check-boxes are saved. You can autofill textfields and various controls in a web form using either the most used or the last used formhistory data.\n\nAll text data that has been stored can easily be retrieved and managed. This extension also offers the possibility to export/import form history data allowing you to exchange data between multiple browser configurations. You can even import data from the old (pre webextension) version.\n\nIf you experience problems regarding form history not being saved, please check if you have cookies enabled.\nThis add-on uses indexeddb to store its information and by disabling cookies this issue (see bugzilla) may prevent data to be stored. So please check the Privacy and Security preferences of the browser and make sure that cookies are accepted or Form History Control will not be able to store your data.\n\nThis add-on now uses the new mandatory WebExtensions API which no longer offers access to Firefox's built-in formhistory database. To overcome this limitation this add-on will create and maintain its own private formhistory database which initially will be empty.\nThere are however two ways to get the formhistory data from the old version back into the new version:\n\n    If you have an export file from the old version, you can simply import that file into the new version. The exportfile is compatible with the new version.\n    If you have no importfile, I published a standalone Java application that can export the formhistory data from the old version. This formhistory-export application is on github along with instruction on how to use it.","weeklyDownloads":75,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Stephan Mahieu","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/2022897/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/207/207581.png?modified=1622132535","width":986,"height":493,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/207/207581.jpg?modified=1622132535","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":266,"caption":"The main control dialog, opens from right-click menu.

You can still use the button or tab right click menu from this addon to duplicate tabs. Configuring this add on's switch focus will not affect the default Firefox duplicate menu option.\n\nPlease note that most functionality is not possible on Android at the moment due to limitations in Android's APIs (no keyboard shortcuts). Duplicate Tab is written so that if the APIs become available in later releases then the features should automatically become usable without an update to Duplicate Tab needed.\n\nSource, issues: https://github.com/Skeletonxf/duplicate-tab","weeklyDownloads":16,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Skeletonxf","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13172583/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.1304,"reviewCount":13,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duplicate_tab/reviews/","updateDate":1652299620000}]}
