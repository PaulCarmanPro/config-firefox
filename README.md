# configuration-firefox
firefox blank slate

### Purpose
Every web brower stores ever gigabytes of information. You can tell Firefox to clear its cache and cookies and Firefox will act as if it did, but a quick look at what it is storing tells the truth. Firefox permanately records a lot of stuff. The only way to clean it out is to delete all of it.

This repository is what existed after a totally clean initial run of Firefox with extensions installed and some about:config settings set. 

###ToDo
- [ ] Stop using firefox-esr like a rebel. Use firefox.
- [ ] Record the changes actually made in about:config. Telling firefox to show changes shows a lot.
- [ ] Define what each preloaded extension does in this readme.
- [ ] Create a way to redfine the keyboard.
- [ ] Create a way to keep only the desirable cookies (automatically delete the rest).
