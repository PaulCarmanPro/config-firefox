firefox blank slate

Every web brower records almost everything. Everywhere you have been and everything you typed consumes a lot of ever expanding storage space. You can tell Firefox to clear its cache and cookies and Firefox will act as if it did, but a quick look at what it is storing tells the truth. Firefox permanately records a lot of stuff.

The ever expanding gigabytes of information stored by web browsers comsume massive amounts of resources and slow the entire system. The only way to clean it out is to delete all of it. But who wants to reload the extensions and change obscure settings in about:config again?

This repository is what existed after a totally clean initial run of Firefox with extensions installed and some about:config settings set.
